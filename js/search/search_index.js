architecture: Business Logic & Auth handled in separate modules, separating\nconcerns.\nHTTP requests are handled by Controllers\n API documentation using nest/swagger module \nBusiness logic is implemented in Services\nDatabase interactions are handled using Prisma\nValidation using NestJS Pipes\nData Transfer Object(DTO) pattern for transferring data between layers\nConfiguration management using .env files for development, test & prod configs\nAuthentication / Authorization, Event ownership by users\nPassportJS, JWT tokens, Password hashing, salts\nUnit tests using Jest\nSupertest for E2E testing\n\nTechnical documentation using Compodoc\nAs NestJS is heavily inspired by Angular, we can generate the documentation about project\nstructure modules, controllers, services etc. I have
